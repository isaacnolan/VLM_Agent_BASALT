  "velocity_guidance": "IMPORTANT - Velocity and Obstacle Detection:\nYou can estimate velocity from the history of images by observing how the visual scene changes between frames. If you have been taking movement actions (like forward, sprint) but the visual scene shows little to no change between consecutive frames, this indicates a HIGH PROBABILITY of an obstacle blocking your path. In such cases:\n- The lack of visual motion suggests you are stuck or blocked\n- You should IMMEDIATELY take action to maneuver around the obstacle\n- Consider: turning the camera to look around, strafing left/right, jumping, or backing up\n- Avoid continuing the same forward movement that led to being stuck"
